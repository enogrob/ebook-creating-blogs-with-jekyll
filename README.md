**About**

Learn to create your own blog using the `Jekyll` static site generator. You’ll start with a simple template, add new features to it, automate any maintenance, attach social sharing, and begin writing. By the end of Creating Blogs with `Jekyll`, you will be able to create custom blogs with `Jekyll`, update the content with ease, and reach out to your readers with minimal effort. Because you've built your blog yourself, you'll know exactly how each component works, and you won’t be dependent on an admin panel to maintain it.
